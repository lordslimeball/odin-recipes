                    <h2>Description</h2>
                        
               <p>Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.</p>
               <p>One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colours—green, white, and red—were those of the Italian flag.</p>

                                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                                    <ul>DOUGH (8 PIZZAS)
                                       <li> 800 g strong white bread flour </li>
                                        <li>200 g fine ground semolina flour or strong white bread flour</li>
                                        <li>1 level teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
                                       <li>2 x 7 g sachets of dried yeast</li>
                                       <li>1 tablespoon golden caster sugar</li>
                                       
                                      <ul>  TOMATO SAUCE (4 PIZZAS)</ul>
                                       <li> 1 clove of garlic</li>
                                       <li> 1 bunch of fresh basil</li>
                                        <li>olive oil</li>
                                       <li>1 x 400 g tin of quality plum tomatoes</li>
                                    </ul>
                                        <h4>Steps</h4>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but its not essential for a thin crust.</li>
                                                <li>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
                                                <li>Roll out the dough: if you've let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
                                                <li>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>

                                            </ul>
